The datasets presented in this repository have been created as a newer alternative to historically used datasets.

These datasets are curated in the sense that they are balanced with each having nearly the exact same number of samples for each class.

They are currently provided in pcap format which can be opened and if necessary converted, by Wireshark.

Additional datasets will be brought online periodically.
